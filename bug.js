This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, particularly on Android. The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` might return inaccurate dimensions, especially when the app is launched for the first time or after a configuration change (e.g., screen rotation).  The problem is that the values returned are not yet fully updated, so using them immediately can lead to layout issues.  This is more prevalent on Android than on iOS.

```javascript
import { Dimensions, View, Text } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ width: width, height: height }}>
      <Text>Incorrect dimensions!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```
